A first stab at making a theme for Beamer in McMaster University colours. At this stage, it's pretty basic -- I took the AnnArbor theme and altered it. To use, simply dump the two .sty files in your LaTeX Beamer presentation's working directory and use the option ```\usetheme{McMaster}``` in your preamble.

TODO

* Maybe fix that gradient thing at the bottom
* Logos? 
* What's That Blue Text Doing Here?
